# AvatarForge

A standalone Android app that **generates, auto-rigs, animates and renders a photorealistic
full-body 3D avatar entirely on the device** — from a text prompt, a photo, or a two-image
multi-reference flow.

No server. No network of any kind. No game engine. The app must work in airplane mode, and an
`INTERNET` permission in the manifest is treated as a build failure.

## Status, in one paragraph

The kernel, renderer, SDK and app are written and build. The host test harness passes **386 checks
with 0 failures**; the C++ kernel implements **47/47** ABI symbols, and the Rust core implements
15/47 against the same ABI with byte-identical results on everything it covers. **Nothing in this
repository has been run on a physical Android device yet** — there is no phone and no GPU in the
build environment — so the honest claim is *implemented and host-verified*, not *device-proven*.
`DEVICE.md` is the ordered sheet a human runs on hardware, and `tools/device_check.sh` collects the
evidence in one command. `STATUS.md` keeps the per-phase state and the list of what is deliberately
still missing.

## Repository layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `native/include/afcore.h` | **The shared C ABI** — the single contract every native implementation answers to |
| `native/src/` | C++17 engine kernel: anatomy → field → isosurface → UV → bake → rig → blendshapes → clips → GLB |
| `native/src/render/` | Custom Vulkan (primary) and OpenGL ES 3.1 (fallback) renderers, written from scratch |
| `native/src/android/` | JNI bridge |
| `rust/af-core/` | Rust implementation of the same ABI — engine logic, anatomy, prompt grammar, tables |
| `rust/af-sys/`, `rust/af/` | Raw FFI bindings and the safe Rust wrapper |
| `app/` | Jetpack Compose UI (input → progress → viewer/editor → export) |
| `sdk/` | Documented Kotlin SDK (`AvatarEngine.health/capabilities/generateFromText/generateFromImage/…`) |
| `abi/afcore.abi.json` | Generated ABI manifest — sizes, offsets, enum values, symbol list |
| `tools/` | Build scripts and every verification gate (see below) |
| `engine/` | Renderer-side assets/shaders support |
| `STATUS.md`, `BUILD.md`, `DEVICE.md` | Where it stands · how to build · how to verify on hardware |

## Build

```bash
tools/bootstrap_toolchain.sh          # SDK + NDK + CMake + Gradle + JDK 17 + Rust (once)

tools/build_host.sh test              # kernel + 386-check host harness (no device, no Android SDK)
tools/build_android.sh                # arm64 native libraries into prebuilt/
tools/build_gradle.sh :app:assembleDebug :sdk:assembleRelease
```

Full details, including the 2 GB container recipe and JDK/SDK paths, are in **`BUILD.md`**.

## Verification

Every one of these is a gate that fails loudly; none of them needs a device.

```bash
tools/verify.sh                       # everything below, in one run
tools/build_host.sh test              # 386 checks: geometry, rig, bake, ABI, GLB round trip, scene
python3 tools/abi_manifest.py --check # the checked-in manifest still matches afcore.h
python3 tools/abi_conformance.py build-host/libafcore.so --require-complete
python3 tools/abi_conformance.py rust/target/release/libafcore.so --reference build-host/libafcore.so
tools/prompt_parity.sh                # C++ and Rust prompt grammars, diffed over a 72-prompt corpus
python3 tools/validate_glb.py <file>  # exported GLB structure + accessor bounds
```

On hardware:

```bash
tools/device_check.sh --apk artifacts/avatarforge-debug-arm64.apk --soak 120
```

## Design rules this codebase holds itself to

* **Airplane mode is the normal case.** No HTTP, sockets, telemetry, or remote model fetches. Models
  and clips ship in the APK.
* **No fakes.** No placeholder generation, no disabled buttons, no feature that reports success
  without doing the work. When something is unsupported the code says so with a specific reason —
  e.g. a GLB import refuses to half-adopt a foreign skeleton and reports `joint_count == 0` rather
  than looking rigged and not animating.
* **A missing measurement is never a zero.** The frame profiler reports `-1` for GPU timings on
  devices that cannot measure them instead of a plausible-looking `0.0`.
* **The custom renderer stays custom.** Vulkan is the primary backend and OpenGL ES 3.1 the
  fallback; no third-party engine is linked.
* **Determinism.** The same spec produces byte-identical geometry, and that is asserted, not assumed.

## Download and install the Android APK

**Fastest route:** open the [Android APK workflow](https://github.com/davealone69-gif/AvatarForge/actions/workflows/android-apk.yml) and open the latest successful run. Under **Artifacts**, download `AvatarForge-Android-<commit>` and extract the ZIP. Install `AvatarForge-debug-arm64.apk` for testing on a modern ARM64 Android phone.

For a versioned, easy-to-find download, open [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/davealone69-gif/AvatarForge/releases). Pushing a version tag such as `v0.10.0` runs the same build and attaches the debug APK, release APK, and SDK AAR to that release.

The release APK currently uses the repository's fallback debug signing certificate unless `keystore.properties` is supplied to a local build. It is suitable for testing, not a production signing identity. Never commit a release keystore or its passwords.

Install from the phone: download the APK, open it in Downloads, and allow installation from that source if Android asks. The APK is ARM64 and targets Android 8.0 (API 26) or newer. AvatarForge is intended to work offline and its APK must not request the `INTERNET` permission.


## Renderer recovery retest (2026-10-21)

A separate recovery build is available for retesting the reported black-viewer / 0 FPS failure. Its physical-device result is still **UNVERIFIED**. See [renderer recovery notes and checksums](docs/RENDERER_RECOVERY_2026-10-21.md) for the bundle identity, exact checksums, download source, and device acceptance checklist. The APK/AAR binaries are not GitHub release assets yet; the notes link to the original Dropbox bundle.
